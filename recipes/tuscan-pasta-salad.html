    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A flavorful diversion from the run-of-the-mill Italian pasta salad. I like to serve this with grilled, fried, or barbecued chicken, and a crusty artisan bread. I would double the portions if you want to have leftovers when serving 4 or more; this goes fast in my home! Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup bow-tie pasta</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups grape tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian dressing (such as Kraft® Tuscan House Italian)</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan mayonnaise (such as Vegenaise®)</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup pepperoncini peppers, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup red onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup sweet banana peppers, diced</li>
        <li>½ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta, tomatoes, Italian dressing, vegan mayonnaise, celery, cucumber, pepperoncini peppers, red onion, banana peppers, olives, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the dressing takes on a creamy consistency and all ingredients are thoroughly coated.</li>
        <li>Season salad with salt and pepper. Serve immediately or refrigerate, mixing again just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
